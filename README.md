# Parameterized ALU in Verilog

## Overview
Designed a scalable ALU supporting N-bit operations with CPU-style flags.

## Features
- Parameterized design (default: 8-bit).
- Operations: Add, Sub, AND, OR, XOR, Shift Left, Shift Right.
- Flags: Zero, Carry, Overflow, Negative.
- Verified with multiple testcases and waveforms.
